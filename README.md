# AI Resume Screening System

An AI-powered Resume Screening and Candidate Ranking System using NLP and machine learning techniques. This tool extracts the text from PDF resumes, preprocesses the content, and ranks candidates based on the similarity between their resumes and the job description using TF-IDF and cosine similarity.

## Key Features
- Upload multiple resumes in PDF format  
- Extracts and preprocess text for analysis  
- Removes special characters and stopwords  
- Extract relevant skills and keywords from resumes  
- Rank candidates based on job description similarity  
- Interactive UI built with Streamlit  

## Tech Stack
- **Python** (NLTK, Scikit-learn, Pandas, PyPDF2, Regex)  
- **Streamlit** (for the web-based interface)
